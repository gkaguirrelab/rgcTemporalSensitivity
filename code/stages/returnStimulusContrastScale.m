function stimulusContrastScale = returnStimulusContrastScale(cellClass,stimulusDirection)

% The RGC data presented by Solomon, Lee, and colleagues was expressed as
% gain, in units of spikes / sec / % contrast. Percent contrast was defined
% in a relative sense
% as the percent of the maximum available contrast available in the
% particular stimulus direction. These were:
%   LMS: 100%
%   L-M: 12%
%     S: 86%
%
% So, an actual 50% S-directed modulation is characterized as a 50/86 =
% 58% relative contrast in this direction.
%
% The gain value was estimated from the linear portion of a Naka-Rushton
% function fit to the contrast response data. For the bistratified and
% midget RGCs, we will assume that the stimuli we are presenting are within
% the linear range of the response. Parasol cells, however, saturate at 25%
% actual / relative contrast; we account for that property here:
